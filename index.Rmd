# Introduction

This work is part of the MadFates project, run by Joachim TÃ¶pper. The goal is to learn bit about the Madinley model and its potential for modelling biomass distributions across trophic levels in Norwegian boreal ecosystem. Perhaps limited to forests.

## Terms and definitions

Cohorts - Organisms with similar functional roles are grouped into cohorts which are treated as sinle entities in the model to reduce computational requirements.

Stock - autotrofic biomass is treated as a single entity (stock).
