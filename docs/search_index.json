Kolstad 2021-12-16 Chapter 1 Introduction This work is part of the MadFates project, run by Joachim TÃ¶pper. The goal is to learn bit about the Madingley model and its potential for modeling biomass distributions across trophic levels in Norwegian boreal ecosystem. Perhaps limited to forests. This page is hosted in GitHub and produced using bookdown. 1.1 Some useful links Paper on the R package Paper on the model itself 1.1.1 Examples of use Removing carnivores Land-use change 1.2 Terms and definitions Cohorts - Organisms with similar functional roles are grouped into cohorts which are treated as sinle entities in the model to reduce computational requirements. Stock - autotrofic biomass is treated as a single entity (stock). Model initialisation - After loading input data the model is run once without a year parameter. Not sure why exactly, or what the output is. Spin-up phase - The model needs to run for 100-1000 simulated years without any user modifications to allow the ecosystem componets to reach a stable state. HANPP - human appropriation of net primary productivity. The variable spans from zero (or actually with some points &lt;0 which I dont understand how to interpret) and 1200. Im not sure what the units are, but probably they are the same as for the autrophic biomass. In case study 2 they simply set the value to a uniform value between zero and one in this way: sptl_inp$hanpp[] = fractional_veg_production[i] and set apply_hanpp =1 which reduces NPP in fractions provided in the hanpp spatial input raster. The example HANPP input data is from year 2005. library(MadingleyR) library(raster) sptl_inp = madingley_inputs(&quot;spatial inputs&quot;) ## Warning: package &#39;rgdal&#39; was built under R version 4.1.2 ## Reading default input rasters from: C:/Users/anders.kolstad/Documents/R/R-4.1.1/library/MadingleyR/spatial_input_rasters............. raster::plot(sptl_inp$hanpp, main = &quot;HANPP anno 2005&quot;) "],["installation.html", "Chapter 2 Installation", " Chapter 2 Installation Madingley is written in C++, but an R version is also available. Although a little bit less flexible perhaps, it should be more than sufficient four this project. And much more familiar. Madinley requires libm.so.6: version GLIBC_2.29. I thnk this is required for running the C++ executables. Perhaps its only requires on linux machines, i dont know. But in any case, the Rstudio server on NINA (Ubuntu 18.04) har libc6 v. 2.27 and IT dont want to upgrade due to dependencies with other software. Therefore Im forces to work locally on my Windows laptop. library(devtools) install_github(&#39;MadingleyR/MadingleyR&#39;, subdir=&#39;Package&#39;, build_vignettes = F, force = T) I still could not get the vignettes to build. It crashes between line 133-144 in Madingley.Rmd which is where madingley_run() is first used. MadingleyR::madingley_version() Versions are up-to-date.

Also one can set the maximum number of cohors allowed per cell. The default is 500 and max is 1000. a higher number increases computation time due to more cohort interactions. mdata &lt;- madingley_init(spatial_window = spatial_window, cohort_def = chrt_def, stock_def = stck_def, spatial_inputs = sptl_inp, max_cohort = 100) % Processing: realm_classification, land_mask, hanpp, available_water_capacity % Processing: Ecto_max, Endo_C_max, Endo_H_max, Endo_O_max % Processing: terrestrial_net_primary_productivity_1-12 % Processing: near-surface_temperature_1-12 % Processing: precipitation_1-12 % Processing: ground_frost_frequency_1-12 % Processing: diurnal_temperature_range_1-12 % Runtime is just a few seconds. str(mdata, 1) % List of 6 % $ cohorts :&#39;data.frame&#39;: 1584 obs. of 16 variables: % $ stocks :&#39;data.frame&#39;: 32 obs. of 3 variables: % $ cohort_def :&#39;data.frame&#39;: 9 obs. of 14 variables: % $ stock_def :&#39;data.frame&#39;: 2 obs. of 10 variables: % $ spatial_window: num [1:4] 31 35 -5 -1 % $ grid_size : num 1 The output contain the cohors and stocks for each pixel. save(mdata, chrt_def, mdl_prms, sptl_inp, stck_def, file = &quot;data/initOut_demo.RData&quot;) "],["step-4---spin-up-and-demonstrating-plotting-functions.html", "Chapter 4 Step 4 - Spin-up and demonstrating plotting functions", " Chapter 4 Step 4 - Spin-up and demonstrating plotting functions library(MadingleyR) knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment=&#39;%&#39;) load(&quot;data/initOut_demo.RData&quot;) The spin-up usualy requires a 100-1000 year simulation for the ecosystem parameters to stabilise.

Endothermic carnivores and herbivores are the biggest animals, but they make up a low proportion of the total biomass. Omnivorous ectotheric and semelparous species (insects) make up the bulk biomass. Note: The individual body mass is here the mean of all cohorts. If reproduction is low, mean individual body mass increases because of a higher propotion of older individuals (higher biomass in the cohors containing older individuals). plot_densities(mdata2) % loading inputs from: temp/madingley_outs_16_12_21_15_34_12/ Im not good at reading these figures yet. plot_trophicpyramid(mdata2) % loading inputs from: temp/madingley_outs_16_12_21_15_34_12/ Hmm, omnivores have a big biomass but only feed on herbivores, not plants.

Plot the spatial biomass plot_spatialbiomass(mdata2, functional_filter = TRUE) % loading inputs from: temp/madingley_outs_16_12_21_15_34_12/ The next step I think is to go though the model parameters in mdl_prms and see if the settings make sense for boreal, mainly forested or alpine, ecosystem. We can also change values in the spatial input sptl_inp, for example setting the max biomass for ectotherms (we dont have large reptiles here).
