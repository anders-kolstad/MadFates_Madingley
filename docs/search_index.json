Kolstad 2021-12-22 Chapter 1 Introduction This work is part of the MadFates project, run by Joachim Töpper. The goal is to learn bit about the Madingley model and its potential for modeling biomass distributions across trophic levels in Norwegian boreal ecosystem. Perhaps limited to forests. This page is hosted in GitHub and produced using bookdown. 1.1 Some useful links Paper on the R package Paper on the model itself 1.1.1 Examples of use Removing carnivores Land-use change 1.2 Terms and definitions Cohorts - Organisms with similar functional roles are grouped into cohorts which are treated as sinle entities in the model to reduce computational requirements. Stock - autotrofic biomass is treated as a single entity (stock). Model initialisation - After loading input data the model is run once without a year parameter. Not sure why exactly, or what the output is. Spin-up phase - The model needs to run for 100-1000 simulated years without any user modifications to allow the ecosystem componets to reach a stable state. HANPP - human appropriation of net primary productivity. The variable spans from zero (or actually with some points &lt;0 which I dont understand how to interpret) and 1200. Im not sure what the units are, but probably they are the same as for the autrophic biomass. In case study 2 they simply set the value to a uniform value between zero and one in this way: sptl_inp$hanpp[] = fractional_veg_production[i] and set apply_hanpp =1 which reduces NPP in fractions provided in the hanpp spatial input raster. The example HANPP input data is from year 2005. library(MadingleyR) library(raster) sptl_inp = madingley_inputs(&quot;spatial inputs&quot;) ## Warning: package &#39;rgdal&#39; was built under R version 4.1.2 ## Reading default input rasters from: C:/Users/anders.kolstad/Documents/R/R-4.1.1/library/MadingleyR/spatial_input_rasters............. raster::plot(sptl_inp$hanpp, main = &quot;HANPP anno 2005&quot;) "],["installation.html", "Chapter 2 Installation", " Chapter 2 Installation Madingley is written in C++, but an R version is also available. Although a little bit less flexible perhaps, it should be more than sufficient four this project. And much more familiar. Madinley requires libm.so.6: version GLIBC_2.29. I thnk this is required for running the C++ executables. Perhaps its only requires on linux machines, i dont know. But in any case, the Rstudio server on NINA (Ubuntu 18.04) har libc6 v. 2.27 and IT dont want to upgrade due to dependencies with other software. Therefore Im forces to work locally on my Windows laptop. library(devtools) install_github(&#39;MadingleyR/MadingleyR&#39;, subdir=&#39;Package&#39;, build_vignettes = F, force = T) I still could not get the vignettes to build.

The resolution is defined by the spatial input rasters, but 1 degree resolution is the maximum. Finer resolution is possible, ut not courser. I will therefore focus on just Central Norway.

There should be almost no ectotherm biomass in winter. Bird migration I dont think is accounted for either. I predict this will be the biggest challenge - getting the Madingley model to capture the seasonal phenological stages. Exploring the cohorts in mdata2. Looking only at herbivorous endotherms, we can look at the relationship between individual size and abundance temp &lt;- mdata2$cohorts temp &lt;- temp[temp$FunctionalGroupIndex==0,] ggplot(data = temp)+ geom_point(aes(x = log(IndividualBodyMass), y = log(CohortAbundance) ), alpha=.1, size=8, colour=&quot;blue&quot;, pch=16)+ theme_bw(base_size = 20) # plotting all grid cells and all cohorts or FG 0 No relationship. Lets look at biomass differences between functional groups. First,let make more intuitive names for the functional groups. link &lt;- data.frame( FG = seq(0,8,1), FGname = c(&quot;Endo. herb.&quot;, &quot;Endo. carn.&quot;, &quot;Endo. omni.&quot;, &quot;Ecto. sem. herb.&quot;, # semelparous (insect etc) &quot;Ecto. sem. carn.&quot;, &quot;Ecto. sem. omni.&quot;, &quot;Ecto. itero. herb.&quot;, # iteroparous (reptiles etc) &quot;Ecto. itero. carn.&quot;, &quot;Ecto. itero. omni.&quot; ) ) temp &lt;- mdata2$cohorts temp2 &lt;- aggregate(data = temp, IndividualBodyMass~factor(FunctionalGroupIndex), FUN = mean) temp2$CohortAbundance &lt;- aggregate(data = temp, CohortAbundance~factor(FunctionalGroupIndex), FUN = mean)[,2] names(temp2)[1]&lt;- &quot;FG&quot; temp2$FG &lt;- as.character(temp2$FG) temp2$FGname &lt;- link$FGname[match(temp2$FG, link$FG)] ggplot(temp2, aes(x = CohortAbundance, y = IndividualBodyMass, label = FGname))+ geom_text(size = 5, position = position_dodge2v(2000))+ theme_bw(base_size = 20)+ scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult=c(.2,.2)))+ scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult=c(.2,.2))) Obs, beware of strong dodging in this figure in place to be able to read all labels. Endothermic carnivores and herbivores are the biggest animals. Omnivorous ectotheric and semelparous species (insects) are small but numerous. The total biomass for a trophic group must somehow be the product of these two axes (se biomass pyramid below). Note: The individual body mass is here the mean of all cohorts. If reproduction is low, mean individual body mass increases because of a higher proportion of older individuals (higher biomass in the cohorst containing older individuals). plot_densities(mdata2) % loading inputs from: temp/madingley_outs_21_12_21_10_29_15/ This figure is showing the distribution of total cohort biomass for each FG. For Herbivores (top right), the distribution is left-skewed, telling us that there is a threshold for how big a cohort cen get. This can be due to reproductive limitations og perhaps intraspecific competition leading to starvation or dispersal. Ectotherm biomass has a clear optimum, but no limitation in size, probably due to high plasticity in reproductive rates. plot_trophicpyramid(mdata2) % loading inputs from: temp/madingley_outs_21_12_21_10_29_15/ Se the pge on trophic pyramids for a more detailed exploration of this figure and what it contains.

Omnivorous insects must have a high turn over, because their combined biomass is low at any one time. Plot the spatial biomass plot_spatialbiomass(mdata2, functional_filter = TRUE) % loading inputs from: temp/madingley_outs_21_12_21_10_29_15/ The next step I think is to go though the model parameters in mdl_prms and see if the settings make sense for boreal, mainly forested or alpine, ecosystem. We can also change values in the spatial input sptl_inp, for example setting the max biomass for ectotherms (we dont have large reptiles here). 5.2 Single grid cell Using a single grid cell we can run the simulation for longer, and see how that affects things. spatial_window = c(9, 10, 60, 61) plot_spatialwindow(spatial_window, ylim=c(55,65), xlim=c(-10,20), input_raster = mat) mdata &lt;- madingley_init(spatial_window = spatial_window, cohort_def = chrt_def, stock_def = stck_def, spatial_inputs = sptl_inp, max_cohort = 100) % Processing: realm_classification, land_mask, hanpp, available_water_capacity % Processing: Ecto_max, Endo_C_max, Endo_H_max, Endo_O_max % Processing: terrestrial_net_primary_productivity_1-12 % Processing: near-surface_temperature_1-12 % Processing: precipitation_1-12 % Processing: ground_frost_frequency_1-12 % Processing: diurnal_temperature_range_1-12 % Using 100 years instead of 10 mdata2 &lt;- madingley_run( out_dir = &quot;temp&quot;, madingley_data = mdata, years = 100, cohort_def = chrt_def, stock_def = stck_def, spatial_inputs = sptl_inp, model_parameters = mdl_prms, max_cohort = 100, silenced = TRUE) % Warning in system(run_exec, intern = T): running command &#39;&quot;C:/Users/ % anders.kolstad/Documents/R/R-4.1.1/library/MadingleyR/win_exec/madingley.bat&quot;&#39; % had status 5 # Runtime approx 45 sec plot_timelines(mdata2) % Warning in xtfrm.data.frame(x): cannot xtfrm data frames % Warning in xtfrm.data.frame(x): cannot xtfrm data frames The components seem to stabilise relatively fast, and after ~20 years there are no long-term trends (results vary between each time this page is rendered).

The biggest species are probably snakes. Carnivores can grow to 40 kg. About right for a wolf. Bears are omnivores. They can grow to 200 kg in Norway. Pure herbivores are allowed to grow to about 500 kg. The data make sense, also for Norway. NPP tmap_arrange( tm_shape(sptl_inp$terrestrial_net_primary_productivity[[1]], bbox = box)+ tm_raster() , tm_shape(sptl_inp$terrestrial_net_primary_productivity[[7]], bbox = box)+ tm_raster() ) NPP for January to the left and july to the right. NPP is zero in winter, which is good. "],["trophic-pyramids.html", "Chapter 7 Trophic pyramids", " Chapter 7 Trophic pyramids Exploring the biomass time series produced from running a 10 year spinup for 16 grid cells in central Norway. This page was last updated 2021-12-22 10:03:02 plot_trophicpyramid(mdata2) % loading inputs from: temp/madingley_outs_22_12_21_08_31_24/ Hmm, omnivores have a big biomass but only feed on herbivores, not plants. Autotrophic biomass is one quadrillion, or 100 trillion, og 10 000 billion kg. Thats 100 billion tons. These numbers are way to high. According to Wikipedia, 100 billion tons C is about 1/5th of the world biomass. Perhaps the unit in this figure should be g and not kg. The spatial inputs are given in grams, so it would make sense if these were also in grams. But even then the number is too big, even after converting biomass to C. Hoeks et al 2020 Glo. Eco. Bio. got comparable values to us when using the same R package and same study extent (4x4 degrees). Harfoot et al 2014 got much lower values. For a single grid cell (aseasonal ecosystem in tropical Uganda) they got 24 611 tons og plant biomass. If we multiply that with 16 to become comparable to our study extent, we get 3.9377610^{5} tons, which is 2.662252510^{-7} times smaller than what we got. However, how do our monthly estimates compare to Harfoot et al 2014. # our max monthly estimate in the last year of the spin up, converted to tons: (temp &lt;- max( mdata2$time_line_stocks$TotalStockBiomass[ mdata2$time_line_stocks$Year==max(mdata2$time_line_stocks$Year) ])/1000) % [1] 2.14235e+11 #harfoots estimate harfoot &lt;- 24611*16 temp/harfoot % [1] 544053 Our values are about halv a million times bigger. If the values are actually in gs and not kg: temp &lt;- temp/1000 temp/harfoot % [1] 544.053 were still far off. The autrophic biomass in this figure is summed, accumulated for the whole of the last year. This is what the code looks like, (slightly modified) in plot_trophicpyramid() years &lt;- 0 tl &lt;- mdata2$time_line_stocks tl &lt;- aggregate(tl, by = list(tl$Year), FUN = sum) tl &lt;- tl[(nrow(tl) - length(years) + 1):nrow(tl), ] (biom &lt;- mean(tl$TotalStockBiomass)) Let me recreate the number in the figure. Rewrite autrophic biomass in a different way 10^15.17 % [1] 1.479108e+15 This is the same as 1.47 * 10^15 1.47 * 10^15 % [1] 1.47e+15 and the same as paste0(&quot;10^&quot;, round( log10(1.479108e+15), 2)) % [1] &quot;10^15.17&quot; Now if we sum the biomass for the whole last year: (biom &lt;- sum(mdata2$time_line_stocks$TotalStockBiomass[ mdata2$time_line_stocks$Year==max(mdata2$time_line_stocks$Year) ])) % [1] 1.48435e+15 #Converted to base10 scientific paste0(&quot;10^&quot;, round( log10(biom), 2)) % [1] &quot;10^15.17&quot; Thats it. But thats weird, as the same biomass is counted again and again each month. It makes more sense to me to just get the standing biomass for a given month. However, plant biomass peaks not in mid summer, but later. biom &lt;- mdata2$time_line_stocks$TotalStockBiomass[ mdata2$time_line_stocks$Year==max(mdata2$time_line_stocks$Year) ] myY &lt;- seq(0,max(biom), length.out = 5) myY2 &lt;- round(seq(0,log10(max(biom)), length.out = 5), 0) myY2 &lt;- paste0(&quot;10^&quot;, myY2) plot(biom, type=&quot;b&quot;, axes=F, ylab=&quot;Plant biomass (kg)&quot;, xlab=&quot;Month&quot;) axis(1, 1:12, month.abb, las=2) axis(2, myY, myY2) It may be more appropriate to use the max for the last year, or the mean of the max over the last n-years.
