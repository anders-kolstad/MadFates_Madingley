Using test data to initialise the model

```{r setup, include=F}
library(MadingleyR)

Spatial model domain = c(min_long, max_long, min_lat, max_lat)
```{r,  message=FALSE}
spatial_window = c(31, 35, -5, -1)
```

Plot the spatial window to check selection
```{r}
plot_spatialwindow(spatial_window)
```
